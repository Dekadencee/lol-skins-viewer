## Usage

Simply have both the League of Legends Client (must be LCU) and this app open at the same time and the main screen will be populated with all your skins.

## FAQ

#### Q: Is there a way to make it work with the old client?

A: No. The old client is about to be discontinued, therefore this app was designed from the ground up with the League Client Update in mind.

#### Q: Will I get banned?

A: I doubt it.

#### Q: Can I use this on Mac OSX?

A: Not yet.

#### Q: This app looks a lot like the League Client Update, why?

A: I like how the LCU looks and wanted this app's users to feel at home by using an already familiar UI.

#### Q: Can I contribute?

A: Sure, feel free to open issues and/or PRs.
